### 1.1 What is time series data?

#### 1.1.1 Time Series Data

- A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded successive points in time, often at uniform intervals. 
- In R, time series data can be represented using specialized objects such as 
`ts` in base R or 'zoo' from the zoo package. These objects help maintain the integrity of the time and value relationship in the data.
# Load the AirPassengers dataset lata("AirPassengers")
# rint the AirPassengers time series print(AirPassengers)

Temporal data classes in R

Data Classes in R

In R, temporal data can be represented
using different classes such as numeric ,
character , Date ,and POSIXct
Each class has its own way of storing and
manipulating date and time information.
Understanding these classes is crucial for
effective time series analysis.

# Example of checking the class of a dat
dates < as.Date("2023-10-01")
lass (dates)

1] "Date"

The class() function is used to determine
the class of an R object, which iS essential
for knowing how to handle the object in your
analysis.
